# code-trial-fnox

Welcome to my application.

This application is a code trial to showcase and prove my skills regarding the Fortnox tech stack.

I've split the documentation into three different chapters and you can read further in respective markdown file. I hope you enjoy reading through the code, documentation as well as testing the application.

## Thoughts, Reasoning & Design

Link: [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/HarryHagelberg404/code-trial-fnox/blob/main/DESIGN.md)

In this chapter I describe my thoughts and underlying reason of the design as well as choices I've made throughout the development of the application. I also touch upon what I would improve or rework if I would have more time or freedom in regards of the requirements.

## Install

Link: [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/HarryHagelberg404/code-trial-fnox/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

To install and run this application locally I've documented the instructions in the link above. I've also deployed the application on a public server available at:

## Testing

Link: [TESTING.md](https://github.com/HarryHagelberg404/code-trial-fnox/blob/main/TESTING.md)

The test effort is documented in the link above. I describe coverage as well as what i would want to test if I had more time available.

### Time spent

Initially I communicated that I estimated that the code trial would take approximately four weeks to complete. The estimation was based on of simultaneously having a full time job as well as some other private obligations. I estimated that I would spend three to four hours per week developing but in the grand total it was more closer about five hours a week. The reason I spent extra time was that I was reading up about and studying on RXJava as It's very interesting and I wanted to get a head start if in fact my code trial where successfull and I would be offered the job position.
